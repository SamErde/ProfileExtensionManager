# Changelog

All notable changes to the Profile Extension Manager extension are documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Extension × profile matrix view.
- Cross-profile install/uninstall via the VS Code CLI.
- `ALL` badge distinguishing extensions applied to all profiles via VS Code's native flag from those merely installed in every profile.
- Orphaned-extension cleanup (review + confirm, moves to Recycle Bin/Trash).
- No telemetry — this extension does not collect or transmit any data.
- Clicking the activity-bar icon now opens the Extension Matrix automatically; configurable via `profileExtensionManager.openMatrixOnActivityBarClick`.
- Per-row bulk actions in the extension matrix: install in every profile via the CLI, remove from every profile where it's directly installed, and a guided "Apply to all profiles…" shortcut that opens the Extensions view for VS Code's native toggle.
