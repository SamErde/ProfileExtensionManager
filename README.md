# Personas

> [!WARNING]
> This extension is being re-branded from "Profile Extension Manager" because there are too many extensions with *similar* names. This is a test release to see if the new "Persona Manager" name will be allowed.

Easily see and manage which extensions are installed in each VS Code profile, all from one convenient matrix.

## Features

- **Profile x extension matrix**: Show every profile as a column and every extension as a row. Toggle any cell to install or uninstall the extension for that profile.
- **Cross-profile install/uninstall**: Act on any profile directly from the matrix; you never have to switch into a profile just to add or remove an extension from it.
- **Orphan cleanup**: Find extension versions on disk that no profile references, review them (size, last modified), and move them to the Trash/Recycle Bin.
- **Privacy**: This extension never collects or transmits any data.

## Requirements & Limitations

- VS Code Stable or Insiders on Windows, macOS, or Linux.
- Portable installations and custom `--user-data-dir`/`--extensions-dir` are supported.
- Remote workspaces (SSH, WSL, containers, github.dev) are not managed. Profile Extension Manager manages the local desktop install it runs in.

## How It Works

Profile Extension Manager reads the same files VS Code itself maintains: the profile registry and each profile's extension list. All installs and uninstalls run through the official `code` command-line interface, scoped to the right profile (and, when applicable, the right `--user-data-dir`/`--extensions-dir`).

## Releasing (maintainers)

Releases are automated with [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please) and driven by conventional commits: commits merged to `main` accumulate into a bot-managed release PR that maintains `CHANGELOG.md` and the version bump; merging that PR tags the release and publishes a GitHub Release with the packaged `.vsix` attached. No manual version edits or manual `vsce publish` are part of the normal flow.

- Local packaging: `npm run package` builds a `.vsix` into `releases/` (gitignored, not committed).
- Marketplace publishing runs automatically on each release via the `VSCE_PAT` repository secret (rotate before expiry — a failed publish step is the symptom). Manual fallback: `npx vsce publish --packagePath <released .vsix>`.
